\section{Introduction}

Architectures of modern business applications aim to be responsive, elastic and resilient.
To that end, they commonly employ the microservice pattern and message-oriented
middleware.
On top, they may follow principles of Domain-Driven Design to map their domain subject onto these technological concepts.
The domain processes may require a microservice to instruct another to do something and then return the result.
In an architecture which implements communication via HTTP calls for example, this requirement is already addressed by the synchronous nature of the communication protocol.
In an asynchronous one, that is based on messaging, however, the requirement needs to be addressed on the application level instead.
This problem has thus far found very little regard in academic literature.
